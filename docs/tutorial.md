# Tutorials

* [**Installation**](tutorial_installation.md) - Install and how to include this library.
* [**Hello World**](tutorial_hello_world.md) - The most basic full example.
* [**Alternative ways of executing Wren code**](tutorial_executing_code.md) - Run Wren code from file, string, module, etc.
* [**Handling exceptions**](tutorial_exceptions.md) - Handling C++ exceptions inside of Wren.
* [**Binding C++ class functions**](tutorial_binding.md) - Binding classes and functions so you can use them in Wren.
* [**Binding C++ class variables**](tutorial_variables.md) - Binding functions as properties or simple variables, with optional read-only variables.
* [**Binding C++ abstract classes**](tutorial_abstract.md) - How to bind abstract classes.
* [**Binding C++ class operators**](tutorial_operators.md) - Binding overloaded C++ operators such as + - * /.
* [**Pass C++ variables by move**](tutorial_pass_by_move.md) - Example of how to pass a C++ class instance to Wren by move instead of a copy. This only applies when calling Wren functions.
* [**Pass C++ variables by reference or pointer**](tutorial_pass_by_ref.md) - Example of how to pass a C++ class instance to Wren by a reference or by a pointer instead of a copy. This only applies when calling Wren functions.
* [**Call Wren from C++**](tutorial_call_wren.md) - Call Wren functions from C++ and pass or return variables.
* [**Lifetime of objects returned by Wren**](tutorial_lifetime.md) - When does the Wren frees the memory of objects you get from Wren?
* [**Lifetime of objects passed into Wren**](tutorial_lifetime_cpp.md) - When does the Wren frees the memory of objects passed into the Wren?
* [**Binding C++ class methods via external functions**](tutorial_ext_functions.md) - Alternative way of binding classes to Wren.
* [**Creating modules and custom raw modules**](tutorial_building.md) - Modules and internal buildin modules, with optional "raw" modules via strings.
* [**External files and modularity**](tutorial_modules.md) - Loading external wren files and lookup paths explained.
* [**Inheritance via composition**](tutorial_inheritance.md) - A workaround of inheriting C++ classes in Wren.
* [**Using callbacks via Fn.new**](tutorial_callbacks_fn.md) - Pass functions from Wren to C++ to be used as callbacks.
* [**Upcasting**](tutorial_upcasting.md) - Upcasting, when passing around derived classes into functions which accept base class pointers or references.
* [**Lists**](tutorial_lists.md) - Custom arrays and lists.
* [**Accept multiple types via std::variant**](tutorial_variant.md) - Accepting more than one type into C++ function from Wren.
* [**Customize VM behavior**](tutorial_customize.md) - Customize how the VM behaves such as specifying where does System.print outputs.
